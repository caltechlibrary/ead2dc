## Introduction

This tool takes as its input the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) output of an ArchivesSpace resource finding aid in Encoded Archival Description (EAD) format and converts it to an OAI Static Repository containing DC metadata records with links to digital objects. 

The main features of the tool are:

* Both input and output are OAI-compliant XML files.
* All 12 levels of EAD container are supported.
* Titles are inherited down the container hierarchy.
* All other metadata is mapped from the record containing the digital object references.
* Records without digital object references are ignored (i.e. not mapped to the output file)


## Installation

No installation is required. The [ead2dc.py](ead2dc.py) file is designed to be run from the command line, or from within your favorite editing environment.
 

## Usage

At the moment this is a command line script designed to be directly edited before each execution. See the [ead2dc.py](ead2dc.py) file for information. It uses standard Python libraries and has been tested using Python 3.9.17
